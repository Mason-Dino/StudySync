## About The Project

![Product Screenshot](https://github.com/Mason-Dino/StudySync/blob/main/product-pic/Screenshot%202024-08-10%20070905.png?raw=true)

I wanted to make a project that allows students to control their education in way that makes it fun to stay organized. I want you to be able to control as much as possible with StudySync. So I let you pick your own theme, your own appearance mode, and other small customizations! 

With Study Sync you can:
- Make Classes
- Make Assignments
    - **Make Sub Tasks!**
    - Add a due date
    - Add what type of assignment
    - Add a submission link (if there is one)
    - Add a points value
    - Add an impotence value
- Track all of your assignments!
- Customization for you!
- And so many more options!
