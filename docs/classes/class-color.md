# ðŸŽ¨ Class Color

### What is the point of a class color?

> The point of a class color in StudySync is mostly help color code each class for the due soon tab on the left side of the screen. In there you can see every day for the next 7 days and a max of 3 main tasks per day. In that screen you will see that each class will have its own color that you can choose in the setup or class add/edit screen
