# Class Name

### What is the class name?

> The class name is the name that you are going to find in the classes, and if you make an assigment with that class you will find in that assignments page. The class name is what you will find all over the place.

### How do I change the class name?

> If you go to the settings page in the StudySunc application and there is going to be a widget to edit classes you will click on the drop down to find the class you want edit, then click edit class. You should now be in a class edit screen and at the top you should see the class name. You can edit that class name by just taping on it and then typing out the new class name. Once you are done making changes makes sure you click "Update" to processes the changes!
